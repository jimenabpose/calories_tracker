** Write an application for the input of calories **

* User must be able to create an account and log in 
* Implement at least two roles with different permission levels (ie: a regular user would only be able to CRUD on his owned records, a user manager would be able to CRUD users, an admin would be able to CRUD on all records and users, etc.) 
* When logged in, user can see a list of his meals and calories (user enters calories manually, no auto calculations!), also he should be able to edit and delete 
* Each entry has a date, time, text, and num of calories 
* Filter by dates from*to, time from*to (e.g. how much calories have I had for lunch each day in the last month, if lunch is between 12 and 15h) 
* User setting â€“ Expected number of calories per day 
* When displayed, it goes green if the total for that day is less than expected number of calories per day, otherwise goes red 
* All actions need to be done client side using AJAX, refreshing the page is not acceptable. 
* REST API. Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication. 
* In any case you should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly
